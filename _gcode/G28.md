title: Move to Origin
brief: Home one or more axes

experimental: false
since: 1.0.0-beta
group: planner

codes:
  - G28

long:
  - When the firmware receives this command, it moves all (or the supplied) axis's back to the zero endstops as quickly as it can, then backs off by a `[XYZ]_HOME_BUMP_MM` and slowly moves back to the zero endstop activation points to increase position accuracy.

notes:
  - This process is also known as "Homing".

parameters:
  -
    tag: X
    type: boolean
    optional: true
    description: Flag to go back to the X axis origin
  -
    tag: Y
    type: boolean
    optional: true
    description: Flag to go back to the Y axis origin
  -
    tag: Z
    type: boolean
    optional: true
    description: A coordinate on the Z axis

examples:
  -
    pre:
      - 'The must used form of this command is to home all axis:'
    code:
      - G28 ; Go to origin on all axes
    post:
      - When no arguments are provided Marlin will respect the value of `Z_SAFE_HOMING`, `QUICK_HOME` and `HOME_Y_BEFORE_X`.

  -
    code:
      - G28 X Z ; Go to origin only on the X and Z axis
